# Context Management Skill

Multi-modal capture and retrieval system for PAI's Knowledge Layer.

**Key Concept:** All content flows through Telegram as a single front door, creating an immutable log of everything you capture. The daemon processes this into your Obsidian vault with AI-powered tagging, transcription, and semantic search.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install CLIs
cd bin/ingest && ./install.sh
cd ../obs && ./install.sh

# 2. Configure environment (see Telegram Setup below)
# 3. Start the daemon
ingest watch --verbose

# 4. Send something to your Telegram channel
# 5. Watch it appear in your vault!
```

## Components

### `ingest` CLI - Capture

Polls Telegram for incoming content (voice, photos, docs, URLs, text) and processes into Obsidian vault.

```bash
ingest poll          # Check for new messages
ingest watch         # Daemon mode (continuous)
ingest direct        # Send from CLI/clipboard
ingest search        # Search vault
```

### `obs` CLI - Query

Query and retrieve content from your vault.

```bash
obs search "keyword"           # Full-text search
obs search --tag project/pai   # Tag filter
obs load "note-name"           # Load content
obs tags                       # List all tags
```

## Required Configuration

Add to `~/.claude/.env`:

```bash
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=~/Documents/your_vault

# Telegram (separate bots for read/write)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_reader_bot_token        # Polls inbox channel for incoming
TELEGRAM_SENDER_BOT_TOKEN=your_writer_bot_token # Sends from CLI/shortcuts
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=-100your_inbox_channel_id   # Your capture inbox
TELEGRAM_OUTBOX_ID=-100your_outbox_channel_id   # PAI Events (notifications)

# Optional (enables semantic search)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## Daemon Setup (macOS)

The `install.sh` script sets up a LaunchAgent that runs `ingest watch` in the background.

### Manual Control

```bash
# Stop daemon
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pai.ingest-watch.plist

# Start daemon  
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pai.ingest-watch.plist

# Check status
launchctl list | grep pai

# View logs
tail -f /tmp/ingest-watch.log
```

### Linux (systemd)

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/pai-ingest.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=PAI Ingest Watch Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bun run /path/to/bin/ingest/ingest.ts watch
Restart=on-failure
Environment=HOME=%h

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then:
```bash
systemctl --user enable pai-ingest
systemctl --user start pai-ingest
```

## iOS Shortcuts

See [shortcuts/README.md](../../../shortcuts/README.md) for iOS capture shortcuts.

## Claude Code Integration

The Context skill works standalone via CLI commands. For natural language integration with Claude Code, add routing triggers to your CORE skill (or equivalent system prompt):

```markdown
**When user asks about vault, context, knowledge, or notes:**
Examples: "what do I know about", "what context on", "#project/", "#tag", "find notes",
"load context", "search vault", "save to vault", "capture this", "ingest"
→ **READ:** ${PAI_DIR}/skills/Context/SKILL.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Follow two-phase workflow: SEARCH (show table, wait) → LOAD (only after user selects)
```

This enables queries like "What do I know about project X?" to automatically invoke the Context skill's search and load workflow.
